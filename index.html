    Simone's bearing and stage presence earned her the title "the High Priestess of Soul". She was a pianist, singer and performer, "separately, and simultaneously.
<BR>
    Jazz trumpeter <cite>Miles Davis </cite> spoke highly of Simone, deeply impressed by her ability to play three-part counterpoint ,her two hands on the piano and her voice each providing a separate but complementary melody line.
</P>
<p>To make a living, Simone started playing piano at a nightclub in Atlantic City. She changed her name to<quote>"Nina Simone"</quote> to disguise herself from family members, having chosen to play <quote>"the devil's music".</quote>
    She was told in the nightclub that she would have to sing to her own accompaniment, which effectively launched her career as a jazz vocalist. She went on to record more than 40 albums between 1958 and 1974, making her debut with <cite>Little Girl Blue.</cite>

Colpix relinquished all creative control to her, including the choice of material that would be recorded, in exchange for her signing the contract with them.
